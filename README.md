Overview:
This project focuses on detecting and classifying traffic signs from images.
The goal is to build a machine learning model that can identify different traffic sign categories for use in driver assistance and autonomous systems.

Features:
1-Data preprocessing and augmentation
2-Model training and evaluation
3-Support for multiple traffic sign classes
4-Visualization of predictions

Tech Stack:
Python 3.x
TensorFlow / PyTorch
OpenCV
NumPy / Pandas
Matplotlib / Seabor
